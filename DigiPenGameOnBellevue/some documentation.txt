This was made by Shawn as a kind of "readme" and FAQ

1. What scene do I open?
Open Boot.unity, this will lead to the other scenes

2. How do I turn on emulation?
Go to the BitToysManager object in Boot and click the Bit Toys Emulator

3. How do I change colors? They are always the same (for completing the challenge)
Uh, IDK.  I emailed Jacob about this.  Awaiting response.  He fixed it when he demoe'd it but I forgot how he did it :(

4. Where are we going to add the minigames?
How about inside that giant .cs file "TheEntireKiosk.cs" ? See the quest stuff
