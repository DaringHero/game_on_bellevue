This was made by Shawn as a kind of "readme" and FAQ

1. What scene do I open?
Open Boot.unity, this will lead to the other scenes

2. How do I turn on emulation?
Go to the BitToysManager object in Boot and click the Bit Toys Emulator

3. How do I change colors? They are always the same (for completing the challenge)
Uh, IDK.  I emailed Jacob about this.  Awaiting response.  He fixed it when he demoe'd it but I forgot how he did it :(

4. Where are we going to add the minigames?
How about inside that giant .cs file "TheEntireKiosk.cs" ? See the quest stuff

5. How do you backout?
Press escape / back key on device

6.If you put certain things in the Registration text field, there can be special functions
_adminBoot - loadslevel 0

      if (userField.text == "_adminClearRegistration")
      {
        clearChip = true;
      }
      else if(userField.text == "_adminClearChip")
      {
        fullClearChip = true;
      }
      else if(userField.text == "_adminTacticalNuke")
      {
        fullClearServer = true;
      }


7.Why doesn't it build?
Try downgrading the JDK to 8, and try upgrading your android sdk to at least level 26 aka 8.0.
Also, don't worry about trying to pair the scanner to the device, the device should pair automatically when the game starts.  

8.How am I supposed to debug this thing?
Unity Remote doesn't seem to really work because of the external specialized hardware, so not sure about this one.
